software implementation of various mathematical computational methods


EN:
This project contains implementations of various computational methods of linear algebra and mathematical analysis.
This can help novice mathematicians and programmers in understanding how to programmatically implement various computational methods from mathematics.
All methods are implemented in Python 3.9 using appropriate mathematical libraries for data visualization and other things. 
All files have the .ipynb format. Accordingly, you just need to open them in any interpreter or online notebook. 
Data is entered from a file. The appropriate path must be specified.
